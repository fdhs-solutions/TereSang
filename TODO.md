## Phase 6: Quality Assurance (UI/UX Verification)

### 6.1 Visual Testing
- [ ] **Pixel-Perfect Comparison**: Side-by-side React vs Angular screenshots
- [ ] **Cross-Browser**: Same appearance in all supported browsers
- [ ] **Device Testing**: Identical look on mobile/tablet/desktop

### Performance Standards
- [ ] **Load Time**: ≤5% degradation from React version
- [ ] **Interaction Speed**: Same or faster response times
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Maintain similar application footprint

## Implementation Approach

### Conversion Strategy
1. **Parallel Development**: Keep React version running during conversion
2. **Component-by-Component**: Convert one page/feature at a time
3. **Visual Verification**: Screenshot comparison after each conversion
4. **Functional Testing**: Test each feature before moving to next

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Visual Review**: Designer approval for each converted page
- [ ] **Functional Testing**: QA verification of all user flows
- [ ] **Performance Check**: Load time and interaction speed validation
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**: Consistent appearance across browsers

## Risk Mitigation

### UI Consistency Risks
- **Solution**: Maintain exact CSS and use visual diff tools
- **Backup**: Keep React version as reference during development

### Functionality Gaps
- **Solution**: Convert logic first, then optimize for Angular patterns
- **Backup**: Comprehensive test suite covering all user interactions

### Performance Issues
- **Solution**: Monitor bundle size and implement lazy loading
- **Backup**: Performance budget with React version as baseline

## Timeline (UI-Focused Milestones)

- **Week 1-2**: Foundation setup and first page conversion
- **Week 3-4**: Core pages (Landing, Auth, Profile) with visual verification
- **Week 5-6**: Advanced features and complex interactions
- **Week 7-8**: Comprehensive testing and optimization
- **Week 9-10**: Final UI polish and deployment preparation

## Next Steps
1. Create a new folder named `angular-shadi` at the root level (outside the existing Frontend folder)
2. Initialize a new Angular 19+ project inside `angular-shadi` with routing enabled and CSS styling
3. Set up the project structure to mirror the React app's organization
4. Begin with Phase 1: Visual Foundation and replicate CSS and assets
5. Proceed with Phase 2 and beyond as per the plan
